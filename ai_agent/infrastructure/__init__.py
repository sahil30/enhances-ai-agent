Infrastructure Components

This module contains system-level functionality and supporting services:
- Caching systems (memory, Redis, file)
- Reliability patterns (circuit breakers, retries)
- Monitoring and observability
- Batch processing and task management
- Semantic search and indexing
- Health checks and diagnostics
